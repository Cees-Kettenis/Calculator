I decided to do something for fun.

I have created a simple calculator app.

It was not particularly challenging, but I was bored one day and decided to recreate something that everyone has on their phone.
The main thing why is because I wanted a history. How often do you use a calculator and due to the order of operations you must do two or more calculations and you never can remember the firs answer?
Yes, that is me. So, I decided to so something about it.

Feel free to copy this code for you own project.
